# CS481/LAW4045 Digital Law & Technology (Spring '21) beta version 1.0
## Module 1: Algorithmic Hiring & Job Discrimination Law

### Instructions to Viewers:

There are two milestones in two folders, Milestone1 and Milestone2.


### In Milestone 1 there are 4 major sections
- Getting up to speed on data
- Understanding data features
- Investigating a naive algorithm
- Interrogating a more complex model

### In Milestone 2 you will be walked through building your own model!

Exercises are meant to be completed in order. Students will be asked to fill in particular code blocks, justify/explain their actions/approaches, and write up answers to particular theoretical/conceptual questions.

Currently in development we are still working through the dataset's generation and distribution among different groups of individuals to get students to wrestle with various biases that might appear in real-life situations.

Please email comments, concerns, questions, bugs you come across to jonahwu@stanford.edu - I'd greatly appreciate any feedback you can offer.

### Configuring your Jupyter Notebook Instance
- The first milestone on notebook is spread out a lot so you will want to download a table of contents. To do this, after you git clone the contents of the module into a folder, copy and paste the following into your terminal. 
    - $ jupyter nbextension install --user https://rawgithub.com/minrk/ipython_extensions/master/nbextensions/toc.js
    - $ curl -L https://rawgithub.com/minrk/ipython_extensions/master/nbextensions/toc.css > $(jupyter --data-dir)/nbextensions/toc.css
    - $ jupyter nbextension enable toc
- That will conveniently lt you navigate the notebook without needing tos croll from top to bottom!
